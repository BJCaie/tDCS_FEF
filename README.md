## üß† Overview

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **Caie, B. & Blohm, G. (2025). _Variability in the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on free choice behaviour._ Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen‚Äôs University.**

The study investigates **intra- and inter-individual variability** in how **high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)** affects neural and behavioural measures during a **free-choice saccade task**.  
Across **10 sessions per participant (5 participants total)**, we combined behavioural, EEG, and fMRI data to evaluate how stimulation polarity (anodal vs cathodal) influenced:

- Reaction times and psychometric choice curves  
- EEG time‚Äìfrequency responses  
- Variability within and across individuals

We developed a **difference-in-differences (DiD) permutation testing framework** to assess causal effects of tDCS at the **group, individual, and session levels**.

## üß™ Experiment Summary

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Participants** | 5 healthy adults (aged 20‚Äì35) |
| **Sessions per participant** | 10 (5 anodal, 5 cathodal) over ~5 weeks |
| **Task** | Free-choice saccade task |
| **Modality** | Behavioural + EEG + fMRI (for FEF localization) |
| **Stimulation site** | Right Frontal Eye Field (rFEF) |
| **Stimulation type** | High-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), 4√ó1 montage |
| **Current** | 2 mA center electrode, ‚Äì0.5 mA per return electrode |
| **Stimulation duration** | 20 minutes (ramp-up/ramp-down: 30 s) |
| **Counterbalancing** | Polarity order randomized across participants |

### Task

Participants were presented with two peripheral visual targets (left/right).  
Each trial consisted of:

1. **Fixation phase:** central fixation for 800‚Äì1200 ms  
2. **Target onset:** both targets appear with a **temporal onset asynchrony (TOA)** ranging from ‚Äì100 to +100 ms (left/right lead)  
3. **Response:** participants made a **saccadic eye movement** toward their chosen target  
4. **Feedback:** none (to preserve free-choice behaviour)

Trials were divided equally into **pre-tDCS** and **post-tDCS** blocks, allowing for within-session comparison.

### Stimulation Details

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| **Montage type** | 4√ó1 HD-tDCS |
| **Centre electrode** | Anode or cathode (depending on condition) placed over rFEF |
| **Return electrodes** | Surrounding electrodes at 3.5 cm radius |
| **Localization method** | Individual fMRI used to determine rFEF coordinates |
| **Simulation tool** | *SimNIBS* for individualized electric field modeling |

Each participant received **both anodal and cathodal** stimulation across sessions in a randomized order to mitigate order and adaptation effects.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Data Collected

| Data Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Behavioural** | Reaction times (RT), choice proportions (left/right), psychometric functions |
| **EEG** | Continuous recordings during task (pre/post stimulation) |
| **Simulations** | Electric field (E-field) distribution from SimNIBS |
| **fMRI** | Structural & functional localization of right FEF |

## üîç Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Behavioural Analysis
- Fit **psychometric choice curves** (logistic regression) to determine:
  - **PSE (Point of Subjective Equality)**
  - **Slope (sensitivity)**
- Compare **pre- vs post-tDCS** differences by polarity and participant.
- Evaluate **reaction time distributions** (mean, variance, skew).

### 2. EEG Analysis
- Preprocessing with `MNE-Python`:
  - Band-pass filtering (1‚Äì40 Hz)
  - ICA-based artifact removal
- Compute **time‚Äìfrequency decompositions** for alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz) and beta (13‚Äì30 Hz) bands.
- Contrast **pre/post tDCS** epochs to assess event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs).

### 3. Causal Inference (Difference-in-Differences Permutation)
- Implement **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** testing:
  \[
  Œî_{tDCS} = (Post_{Anodal} - Pre_{Anodal}) - (Post_{Cathodal} - Pre_{Cathodal})
  \]
- Use **nonparametric permutation testing** (10,000 shuffles) to evaluate significance.
- Apply analysis at three scales:
  1. **Group level**
  2. **Individual level**
  3. **Session level (intra-individual variability)**

### 4. Electric Field Analysis
- Simulate individual E-field maps using *SimNIBS 4.0*.
- Extract regional mean intensity over the rFEF and surrounding areas.
- Correlate E-field magnitude with behavioural and EEG effect sizes.

## üìà Key Findings

* **Group-level:** tDCS polarity significantly modulated reaction times and corresponding EEG responses, but not choice direction.
* **Inter-individual:** Effects were heterogeneous and often contradictory between participants.
* **Intra-individual:** Even within the same participant, session-level effects varied markedly, suggesting state-dependent or non-stationary influences.

These findings indicate that **tDCS effects are not reliably consistent across sessions or individuals**, challenging assumptions of generalizability in population-level analyses.
