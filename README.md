## üß† Overview

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **Caie, B. & Blohm, G. (2025). _Variability in the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on free choice behaviour._ Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen‚Äôs University.**

The study investigates **intra- and inter-individual variability** in how **high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)** affects neural and behavioural measures during a **free-choice saccade task**.  
Across **10 sessions per participant (5 participants total)**, we combined behavioural, EEG, and fMRI data to evaluate how stimulation polarity (anodal vs cathodal) influenced:

- Reaction times and psychometric choice curves  
- EEG time‚Äìfrequency responses  
- Variability within and across individuals

We developed a **difference-in-differences (DiD) permutation testing framework** to assess causal effects of tDCS at the **group, individual, and session levels**.

## üß™ Experiment Summary

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Participants** | 5 healthy adults |
| **Sessions per participant** | 10 (5 anodal, 5 cathodal) over ~5 weeks |
| **Task** | Free-choice saccade task |
| **Modality** | Behavioural + EEG + fMRI (for FEF localization) |
| **Stimulation site** | Right Frontal Eye Field (rFEF) |
| **Stimulation type** | High-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), 4√ó1 montage |
| **Current** | 2 mA center electrode, ‚Äì0.5 mA per return electrode |
| **Stimulation duration** | 20 minutes (ramp-up/ramp-down: 30 s) |

### Task

Participants were presented with two peripheral visual targets (left/right).  
Each trial consisted of:

1. **Fixation phase:** central fixation for 750‚Äì1250 ms  
2. **Target onset:** both targets appear with a **temporal onset asynchrony (TOA)** ranging from ‚Äì99 to +99 ms (left/right lead)  
3. **Response:** participants made a **saccadic eye movement** toward their chosen target  
4. **Feedback:** none (to preserve free-choice behaviour)

Trials were divided equally into **pre-tDCS** and **post-tDCS** blocks, allowing for within-session comparison.

### Stimulation Details

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| **Montage type** | 4√ó1 HD-tDCS |
| **Centre electrode** | Anode or cathode (depending on condition) placed over rFEF |
| **Return electrodes** | Surrounding electrodes at 3.5 cm radius |
| **Localization method** | Individual fMRI used to determine rFEF coordinates |
| **Simulation tool** | *SimNIBS* for individualized electric field modeling |

Each participant received **both anodal and cathodal** stimulation across sessions in a randomized order to mitigate order and adaptation effects.

| **Behavioural** | Reaction times (RT), choice (left/right) |
| **EEG** | Continuous recordings during task (pre/post stimulation) |
| **Simulations** | Electric field (E-field) distribution from SimNIBS |
| **fMRI** | Structural & functional localization of right FEF |

## üîç Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Behavioural Analysis
- Fit **psychometric choice curves** to determine:
  - **PSE (Point of Subjective Equality)**
  - **Slope (sensitivity)**
- Compare **pre- vs post-tDCS** differences by polarity and participant.
- Evaluate **reaction time distributions** (mean and variance) .

### 2. EEG Analysis
- Preprocessing with `MNE-Python`:
  - Band-pass filtering (1‚Äì40 Hz)
  - Current Source Density Estimation via Surface Laplacian
- Compute **time‚Äìfrequency decompositions** for alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz) and beta (13‚Äì30 Hz) bands.
- Contrast **pre/post tDCS** epochs.

### 3. Causal Inference (Difference-in-Differences Permutation)
- Implement **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** testing:
  \[
  Œî_{tDCS} = (Post_{Anodal} - Pre_{Anodal}) - (Post_{Cathodal} - Pre_{Cathodal})
  \]
- Use **nonparametric permutation testing** (10,000 shuffles) to evaluate significance.
- Apply analysis at three scales:
  1. **Group level**
  2. **Individual level**
  3. **Session level (intra-individual variability)**

### 4. Electric Field Analysis
- Simulate individual E-field maps using *SimNIBS 4.0*.
- Extract regional mean intensity over the rFEF and surrounding areas.

## üìà Key Findings

* **Group-level:** tDCS polarity significantly modulated reaction times and corresponding EEG responses, but not choice direction.
* **Inter-individual:** Effects were heterogeneous and often contradictory between participants.
* **Intra-individual:** Even within the same participant, session-level effects varied markedly, suggesting state-dependent or non-stationary influences.

These findings indicate that **tDCS effects are not reliably consistent across sessions or individuals**, challenging assumptions of generalizability in population-level analyses.

## üß© Reproducibility

All analysis pipelines are designed to be **fully reproducible** using provided data and scripts. The permutation testing results are included in the Zotero folder, as they required significant computational time. However, the scripts to perform the permutation testing are available in 'permutationTestingEEG.py' and 'permutationTestingPsychometrics.py', which run on the raw data included in the Zotero folder
